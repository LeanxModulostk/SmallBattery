# Small Battery

## Description
This module makes the system think that it has a smaller battery than normal, which will apply more precise adjustments to save battery.

## Details:
This will probably disable advanced features (such as the ro.config.low_ram property) that consume more battery.

## Installation
1. Install the module in Magisk (reboot)
